# HIVE
## Hover Interactive Visualisation and Explanation

HIVE aims at reducing the pain of discovering a new world full of its mysterious acronyms. To make learning and integration easier, HIVE makes all acronyms easily understandable.

Based on a database built by the community itself, HIVE offers in one click and in all your webpages an explanation for each of the acronym you encounter. 

## Documentation
We love acronyms because they simplify the way we communicate, except when you are a new hire and still not used to them. To solve this problem, we designed a chrome extension that detects acronyms and display their meaning in a pop-up. When an acronym is not listed or is incorrect, people can easily submit a definition through a website.

### Usage:
Start by downloading the Chrome extension using the following link: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hive/ikiohgcbnkecmddhpjgalmghfakgknaj
Once installed, you can use it on Gmail, KB and JIRA.
Click on activate once to "translate" this page only. You can also use the "Control + Option + H" (H for Hive) keyboard shortcut to activate Hive once on your current page.
If you're a new hire and want all of the gmail/KB/Jira pages to be "translated" directly, switch the toggle to always.

### Additional features:
Use the search bar in the popup to easily search an acronym you just heard.
Click the pencil icon in the tooltips to modify an acronym.
Use the add buttons in the popup to add one or a batch of acronyms.

### External website: 
The website backing the project is available here: https://liveramp-eng-hackweek.appspot.com/. You can modify, add or search acronyms there as well.
